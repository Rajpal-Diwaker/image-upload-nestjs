# Image Upload Nest.js API

This is the backend API for [image-uploader](https://github.com/stuyy/image-upload-react), the front-end react app. This backend API is a Nest.js application that uses Digital Ocean Spaces as an external service.

In order to get this working, you must have a cloud service such as AWS S3 or Digital Ocean's Spaces, or some alternative.
